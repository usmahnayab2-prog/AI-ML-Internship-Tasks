# Iris Dataset Exploration and Visualization

## Task Objective
The goal of this project is to explore and visualize the Iris dataset to better understand the structure, distribution, and relationships of the flower measurements.

## Dataset Used
- **Source:** Seaborn library built-in dataset  
- **Name:** Iris  
- **Features:** 
  - `sepal_length`
  - `sepal_width`
  - `petal_length`
  - `petal_width`
  - `species` (target)

## Models Applied
- No predictive models were applied in this project.  
- Focus was on **data exploration and visualization** using:
  - Scatter plots
  - Histograms
  - Box plots

## Key Results and Findings
1. Petal length varies clearly between species, making it a strong distinguishing feature.  
2. Sepal length and width are more evenly spread across the species.  
3. The dataset contains no missing values and is clean.  
4. Visualizations (scatter plots, histograms, and box plots) helped identify patterns and unusual values effectively.
